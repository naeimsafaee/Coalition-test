# Project Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy the project to a server. Follow these instructions to get your project up and running in a development environment.

## Step 1: Environment Configuration

1. Create a new `.env` file in the project root directory if it doesn't exist.
2. Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
3. Fill in the necessary variables in the `.env` file with the appropriate values:

```
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_PORT=your-database-port
DB_DATABASE=your-database-name
DB_USERNAME=your-database-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
```


Replace the placeholders (e.g., `your-domain.com`, `your-database-host`, etc.) with the actual values for your deployment environment.

## Step 2: Setup and Database Migration

1. Install project dependencies using Composer:
   `composer update`

2. Generate a new application key:
   `php artisan key:generate`

3. Run database migrations to create the necessary tables:
   `php artisan migrate`

4. Run tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
   `php artisan test`


## Step 3: Start the Application

1. Start the application with the following command:
   `php artisan serve`


This will run the application using the built-in PHP development server.

## Final Checks

1. Visit the URL shown in the console after running the `php artisan serve` command to access your application in the browser.

2. Perform necessary checks to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.

3. If you encounter any issues, check the log files in the `storage/logs` directory for error messages.
